5. WHEN I need to understand NEWS2 scoring THEN the system SHALL provide access to detailed scoring explanations
6. WHEN vital signs are entered THEN the system SHALL validate inputs are within physiologically reasonable ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to calculate q-SOFA scores quickly, so that I can identify patients at risk of sepsis-related complications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access q-SOFA calculation THEN the system SHALL display the three q-SOFA criteria on the main screen
2. WHEN I input q-SOFA parameters THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate the total score
3. WHEN the q-SOFA score is calculated THEN the system SHALL display the result clearly
4. WHEN the q-SOFA score is â‰¥2 THEN the system SHALL highlight the increased sepsis risk
5. WHEN I need to understand q-SOFA criteria THEN the system SHALL provide access to detailed explanations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Norwegian healthcare professional, I want the app interface in Norwegian, so that I can use it efficiently in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN it SHALL display all interface elements in Norwegian by default
2. WHEN the app detects the device language THEN it SHALL automatically switch to that language if supported
3. WHEN the app is translated THEN it SHALL maintain medical terminology accuracy across languages
4. WHEN new languages are added THEN the system SHALL support easy translation file management
5. WHEN language switching occurs THEN it SHALL not affect calculated scores or functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional working in various lighting conditions, I want automatic dark mode support, so that the app is comfortable to use in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is set to dark mode THEN the app SHALL automatically switch to dark theme
2. WHEN the device is set to light mode THEN the app SHALL automatically switch to light theme
3. WHEN in dark mode THEN all text SHALL remain clearly readable with appropriate contrast
4. WHEN in dark mode THEN clinical risk indicators SHALL remain visually distinct
5. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN it SHALL happen seamlessly without data loss

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional in a fast-paced environment, I want simple input methods without dropdowns, so that I can enter data quickly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to input vital signs THEN the system SHALL use number input fields or simple button selections
2. WHEN I need to select binary options THEN the system SHALL use toggle switches or radio buttons
3. WHEN I interact with input fields THEN they SHALL be large enough for easy touch interaction
4. WHEN I make input errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback
5. WHEN input fields are displayed THEN they SHALL be logically grouped and clearly labeled

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to calculate both NEWS2 and q-SOFA scores simultaneously using shared input fields, so that I can efficiently assess multiple clinical indicators at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the app THEN it SHALL display a unified set of input fields that serve both NEWS2 and q-SOFA calculations
2. WHEN I view input fields THEN each field SHALL display an indicator showing whether it's used for NEWS2, q-SOFA, or both
3. WHEN I enter patient data THEN both NEWS2 and q-SOFA scores SHALL be calculated and displayed simultaneously
4. WHEN I perform calculations THEN all input fields and both score results SHALL be visible on the main screen
5. WHEN the screen space is limited THEN the layout SHALL adapt while maintaining all essential information visibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional learning or verifying scoring methods, I want access to detailed explanations, so that I can understand and validate the calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need scoring explanations THEN the system SHALL provide detailed NEWS2 scoring criteria
2. WHEN I need scoring explanations THEN the system SHALL provide detailed q-SOFA criteria explanations
3. WHEN I access explanations THEN they SHALL include normal ranges and clinical significance
4. WHEN I view explanations THEN they SHALL be medically accurate and up-to-date
5. WHEN I finish reading explanations THEN I SHALL be able to return to calculations easily

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want access to app settings and information, so that I can customize the app behavior and access general information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
